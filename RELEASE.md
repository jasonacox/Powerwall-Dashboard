* Stack powerwall current energy values in Powerwall Capacity panel by @youzer-name in #430.
* Add "Off Grid" indicators to the bottom of the Frequency and Voltages panels by @youzer-name in #430.

## v4.0.1 - Powerwall Voltages

* Added CQs and updated `dashboard.json` to include voltages from battery block vitals by @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/pull/426. This addresses users no longer seeing Powerwall voltages in the dashboard with firmware 23.44.0 or later - See related https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/109#discussioncomment-8263020

## v4.0.0 - Cloud Mode Support

* Using pyPowerwall for both Local Access and Tesla Cloud mode by @jasonacox and @mcbirse in https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/pull/414 (replaces Tesla-history service, but the Tesla-history tool will continue to be used to fill in historic data or gaps) - See related https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/59
* Removal of Docker Compose profiles (helps with some older systems that don't fully support this) and the v1 related legacy support.
* Updated `setup.sh` and `upgrade.sh` to support transition to pyPowerwall for Tesla Cloud mode.
* Updated `verify.sh` to support Tesla Cloud mode.
* Updated dashboard for solar-only users to include Powerflow Animation panel.

## v3.0.8 - Critical Bug Fix

* Fixes bug in pypowerwall proxy container version before `jasonacox/pypowerwall:0.7.6t39` related to API calls and 404 HTTP status codes handling. Powerwall Firmware version 23.44.0 has eliminated /api/devices/vitals resulting in a 404 response from the Powerwall Gateway (TEG) when this is requested. There was a bug in the pypowerwall code that will treat this 404 like an authentication failure which will result in attempts to log in over and over, eventually hitting the rate limit. This is especially impactful for those using the proxy for things like Powerwall-Dashboard as the rate limit will prohibit other data gathering.

## v3.0.7 - InfluxDB Environment Variables

* Add support to define InfluxDB configuration options by environment variable by @mcbirse. This allows the default configuration settings to be overridden and addresses https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/408 raised by @youzer-name
* Change InfluxDB statistics recording to false by default to reduce CPU load by @youzer-name in https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/pull/410
* Update example backup script to use tar.xz (-J option) by @s-crypt in https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/pull/404 and https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/pull/405 see https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/issues/337
* [[Tools](https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/tree/main/tools)] - default to bash in `pwstatus` script for better compatibility by @mcbirse see https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/249#discussioncomment-7935882

## v3.0.6 - Powerflow Animation Update

* Update to latest pypowerwall proxy t29:
* Default page loaded by proxy (http://localhost:8675/) will render Powerflow Animation. Animation assets (html, css, js, images, fonts, svg) will render from local filesystem instead of pulling from Powerwall TEG portal resulting in faster render time.
